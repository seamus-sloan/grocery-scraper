# Grocery Scraper

Saw my wife with 5 chrome tabs open trying to plot her route between multiple grocery stores to get the lowest prices on all our groceries and figured there had to be a better way. I would have preferred to use something like Playwright to scrape through the websites and return the data... but playwright's user agent was constantly getting blocked. Controlling a _real_ browser avoids that limitation entirely and might even be more convenient anyways.
